# GoldCoreX: A Room-Temperature, Photon-Driven Quantum Architecture

**Created by: Eric Ruecker** 
**White Paper DOI: Coming soon (Zenodo or OSF.io)** 
**Status: Public Research Prototype**

GoldCoreX proposes a scalable quantum computing system using **gold atoms embedded in diamond**, controlled by **photonic waveguides** and powered by **standard voltage**â€”requiring no lasers or cryogenics.

### Features:
- Trillions of potential qubits per chip
- Room-temperature operation
- Photon-driven logic gates
- Fabrication pathway using ion implantation
- Peer-review-ready white paper included

### Included:
- `GoldCoreX_White_Paper_Eric_Ruecker_COVER_FINAL_2025.pdf`
- Quantum qubit design diagrams
- Architecture overview visuals
